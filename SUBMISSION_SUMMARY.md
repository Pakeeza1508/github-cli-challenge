## The Presentation

### What You Say (60 seconds)

```
"YouTube's algorithm kills developer focus.

You open it to learn Docker. Three hours later, 
you're watching shark tank compilations.

gh-focus eliminates the algorithm by:
• Letting you whitelist channels
• Removing all distractions
• Tracking what you actually learn

[Demo the beautiful CLI]

This shows GitHub CLI can do more than automate work—
it can improve developer quality of life.

Questions?"
```

### What You Show (60 seconds)

```

2. Select: Coding category
3. Pick: A video
4. Launch: See it in clean player (no sidebar!)
5. Show: --stats (track learning progress)
```

## If Asked "Why GitHub CLI?"

**You Say:**

"Most GitHub CLI extensions automate GitHub operations. I wanted to show it can solve adjacent problems. Developers already use the CLI. By integrating here, we can build an entire ecosystem of wellness tools—not just automation."

---

## If Asked "Why Not YouTube API?"

**You Say:**

"Three reasons:
1. No API key needed (uses RSS—anyone can use)
2. No rate limits (will work forever)
3. Privacy-first (no external tracking)

This shows the power of creative solutions."

---

## If Asked "What's Next?"

**You Say:**

"We could add:
- Pomodoro timer integration
- Learning progress dashboard
- Channel recommendation system
- Browser extension for direct integration
- Community channel discovery

But the foundation is solid. We proved the concept works."
